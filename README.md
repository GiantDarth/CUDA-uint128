# CUDA-uint128
A 128 bit unsigned integer class for CUDA.  Due to inefficiencies in linking device code with nvcc, this is a header-only library.  This library seeks to provide a convenient uint128_t type for use in CUDA code with most functions and operators defined.  Initial results are promising.  So far, host and device functions for comparisons and arithmetic operations have been defined, though division is strictly 128/64 -> 64 at this point.  I greatly welcome input and/or collaboration on this.
